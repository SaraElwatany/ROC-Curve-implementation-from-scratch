# ROC-Curve-implementation-from-scratch
Implementation of the ROC Curve from scratch, and using it to evaluate a logistic regression model trained on the Iris Dataset offered by Scikit-learn library.

## About
In our implementation we computed the roc curve for each class with respect to the other 2 classes.
The variables used in computing the roc curve were obtained from the micro evaluation scores. Micro Evaluation Scores in its simplest definition represent the evaluation metrics obtained from the total true positives, total true negatives, total false positives, and total false negatives, and these mentioned variables are obtained from the addition/summation of the individual true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each individual class with respect to the other classes.

## Obtained ROC Curves
